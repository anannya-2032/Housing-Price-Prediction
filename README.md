# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Regression Models

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting California house prices using popular regression algorithms. It utilizes the sklearn California Housing dataset and compares multiple models based on evaluation metrics.

---

## 📊 Dataset
We use the *California Housing dataset* available in scikit-learn, which contains features such as:

- MedInc – Median income in the block
- HouseAge – Median house age in the block
- AveRooms – Average number of rooms
- AveBedrms – Average number of bedrooms
- Population – Block population
- AveOccup – Average house occupancy
- Latitude and Longitude

Target:
- MedHouseVal – Median house value (in 100,000s USD)
